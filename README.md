# Project Name
Hello Microverse


In this project, we setuped "Hello_Microverse" repository. The goal of this repository is to understand how linter helps with HTML and CSS, how to use the .gitignore inorder to avoid unwanted files from being visible in our git repository. I have explained below what we used to accomplish this task.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS


## Live Demo (if available)

[Live Demo Link doesn't available for now.]


## Getting Started

The first step is to create a github repository, after that clone the repository. After cloning the repository add readme, .gitignore and linter-config files. Next, add HTML and CSS files to check if linter is working and add test.md file to check if .gitignore file is working.
